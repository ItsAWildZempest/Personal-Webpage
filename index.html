<h2>Reason For Interest</h2> 

<p>I have been interested in music since a young age. It helps me relax and I've always been good at reading and writing so I have always been decent with lyrics. I recently took interest in pc building, and keyboard modding mainly because I love tinkering and customizing my own things to my liking.</p>

<h2>Music</h2> 

<p>I started making music at 11. I began on a old laptop in the grandma's basement. It overheated and burnt me countless times, but it was pretty good. I still have it. Overtime, I began to get better. I got a decent amount of equipment. I have also remade some popular songs.</p>
